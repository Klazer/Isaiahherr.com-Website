          <p> I'm a current Computer Science student studying at the University of Minnesota Twin-Cities. As of right now, I am continously looking to expand my skills in software development in whatever way I can. As a result, I am currently working on my own personal projects in order to gain a variety of experiences in regards to Software Development. In addition to this, I am always looking for an internship, especially for either Fall 2020 or for Spring 2021 leading up until my graduation.
            </p>
            <p>
             Some fun facts about me is that I really love gaming. One of the games that I am currently into right now is Animal Crossing: New Horizons on the Nintendo Switch which I especially love to play and relax to during my free time. In addition to this, I am a massive sneaker head and also a bit of a car guy.
