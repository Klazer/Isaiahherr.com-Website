              <h3> Isaiah Herr's Website </h3>
              <p> This acts as a portfolio for myself and potential employers. This is a personal project in which I decided to learn HTML and CSS completely by myself in addition to helpful resources.
              <p> This website will be consistently updated with new information as I work and complete more projects.

              <h3> Hash Table Project in JAVA </h3>
              <p> This is a project I worked on in class with a partner using JAVA. The goal was to equally distribute collisions across a Hash Table. The program would then return an output stating what values were stored in each position and how many values were stored in that position to the user.
                </p>
              <p> Although this was one of my more basic school projects, I spent many hours with both my partner and instructors in order to get this program to function correctly and am still very proud to present this work.

              <h3> Solar Vehicle Project </h3>
              <p> I was part of the Controls Subteam for Spring 2020 and was in the process learning how PCBs worked in association with different pieces of code. In addition to this, I learned valuable skills such as soldering, however, my experience was cut short due to COVID-19.
              <p> I still intend to be part of this group in the future and this will be updated as time goes by.
